Perspective: The Potential Role of Circulating Lysophosphatidylcholine in Neuroprotection against Alzheimer Disease.,"The article discusses how the brain can only synthesize a few fatty acids, and that higher dietary PUFA intake is associated with decreased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in observational studies. It also states that PUFAs such as DHA are transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the form of LPC via a specific LPC receptor at the BBB known as the sodium-dependent LPC symporter 1 (MFSD2A). Higher dietary PUFA intake is associated with decreased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in observational studies, but PUFA supplementation, with fatty acids esterified in triacylglycerols did not prevent cognitive decline in clinical trials. These findings suggest that insufficient pool of circulating LPC containing long-chain fatty acids could potentially limit the supply of long-chain fatty acids to the brain, including PUFAs such as DHA, and play a role in the pathobiology of AD."

Cat Urine Extract As A Feral Cat Management Tool,"Cats mark their territories with urine markings. This means other cats take interest in the urine markings. When cats sniff other cats markings, they show what is called the Flehmen response. The Flehmen response is the behavior whereby a cat curls back its upper lip, exposes its teeth. This allows the cats to better smell pheromones, such as felinine, in the urine. Cats use these pheromones to identify one another. Unlike dogs, cats do not overmark, or urinate on top of, one anothers markings. Instead, they usually leave the immediate area. Because cats avoid staying in areas marked by other cats, humans have tried to keep cats away from certain areas by placing artificial cat urine markings. We use urine collected from domestic cats for this. But, storing cat urine can be difficult; it tends to decay and emit an ammonia smell, which does not keep cats away.

A proposal for a nonreinstatement rule in unfair labor practice cases involving patient abuse.,"In 1974, the Health Care Institutions Amendments granted health care workers collective bargaining rights similar to those which industrial workers had enjoyed for decades under the National Labor Relations Act. However, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has failed to distinguish employee misconduct in industrial settings from patient abuse in health care institutions when fashioning remedies for discriminatorily discharged union activists. A front pay remedy is more appropriate to these cases because it protects the patients right to be free from abuse without sacrificing employee unionization rights."
Letting Chickens Be Chickens: A Review Of Housing Conditions,"In 1978, Oxford Universitys Animal Behavior Research Group conducted a study on chickens which found that larger cages over smaller ones and grass floors over wire ones were preferred by the animals. Today, this is self-evident even 40 years later. When faced with a large wire-floored cage or a small grass-floored one, the chickens preference for grass outweighed their preference for a large cage. There was no significant difference in preferences between chickens who were kept in battery cages and those that were kept outside prior to the experiment. Of the 16 birds used, 3 preferred the wire floor to the grass one, 3 preferred a small cage to a large one, and 2 preferred the large wire cage to a small grass one. However, these chickens that bucked the trend were considerably more hesitant to enter their preferred cages. In addition, chickens who were kept outside prior to the experiment were much quicker in making their choices than chickens who were previously kept in cages. This indicates that the mental well"

When undertaken, the first approach ensures the presence of consciousness by collecting human experiences of stimuli verbally. The second approach uses human data but is reliant on it. The third approach compares scenarios where stimuli are perceived consciously vs. unconsciously. It suggests that there are multiple consciousness-linked cognitive abilities that could be clustered together; that is, there are robust correlations between them. However, until now, invertebrate cognition has been studied in a rather haphazard fashion, not permitting to fully test the theory-light approach."

The population decreased significantly from mid-autumn to the end of the breeding season. The species is a secondary consumer (Trophic position = 3.36 ± 0.05), preferring amphipods but displaying annual and seasonal dietary plasticity. Mature fish were less selective than immatures (especially females), with a higher preference for amphipods (36-68%) in the former. The second most-preferred prey were carideans, copepods, or isopods, depending on the year and the reproduction state. Overall, the wider trophic niches in females and immature specimens compared to males and mature fish would indicate a higher variability in both the use of prey resources and/or their origin.

Microcarriers for Upscaling Cultured Meat Production,"This paper aims to discuss the MCs design criteria for skeletal muscle cell proliferation and subsequently for meat production based on three scenarios: (1) MCs are serving only as a temporary substrate for cell attachment and proliferation and therefore they need to be separated from the cells at some stage of the bioprocess, (2) MCs serve as a temporary substrate for cell proliferation but are degraded or dissolved during the bioprocess, and (3) MCs are embedded in the final product and therefore need to be edible. The particularities of each of these three bioprocesses will be discussed from the perspective of MCs as well as the feasibility of a one-step bioprocess. Each scenario presents advantages and drawbacks, which are discussed in detail, nevertheless the third scenario appears to be the most promising one for a production process.

Contemporary Visual Art Practice That Involves Live and Deceased Animals.,"This paper examines a selection of 21st-century international examples of exhibited visual artworks involving live or deceased animals, looking into the benefits and risks involved with unique encounters with animals through art.
